There's a common misconception in the biology classroom that [recessive traits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recessive) are
likely to become rarer across generations. This simulation is a toy to help
people explore and understand random trait and gene proliferation.

People are illustrated as a pair of dots. One colored dot per gene. If the
brown eyed gene is present, it will appear in front of the blue eye gene.

Each "sex" generation causes the entire population to randomly pair up and
make 2 children. The results are visible in the bar graphs at the bottom left.
