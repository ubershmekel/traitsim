There's a common misconception in the biology classroom that [recessive traits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recessive) are
likely to become rarer across generations. This simulation is a toy to help
people explore and understand random trait and gene proliferation.

People are illustrated as a pair of dots. One colored dot per gene. If the
brown eyed gene is present, it will appear in front of the blue eyed gene.

Each "sex" generation causes the entire population to randomly pair up and
make 2 children. The results are visible in the bar graphs at the bottom left.

After leaving the "sex party" on for enough time, most likely one of the gene types
will become extinct. The gene type with the lower current gene count is more likely to
decrease further. Note that during a tie with 50% blue vs 50% brown genes,
there are likely to be 25% people with blue eyes and 75% with brown eyes.
