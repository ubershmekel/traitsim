{"google":"UA-4533496-16","body":"﻿[TraitSim][1]\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis simulation is a toy to help explore and understand random trait and gene proliferation.\r\n\r\nThere are common misconceptions in the biology classroom about [recessive traits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recessive).\r\n\r\nMyths:\r\n\r\n* Recessive traits are more likely to go extinct.\r\n* Dominant traits are more likely to grow in numbers with each generation.\r\n* It'd be surprising to find a recessive gene in a majority over a dominant gene (e.g. [O blood type is recessive and the majority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system)).\r\n\r\nTruths:\r\n\r\n* In completely random procreation, neutral recessive and dominant traits are equally likely to go extinct.\r\n* If both gene counts are even, dominant traits are likely to be expressed in 75% of the population.\r\n\r\nA neutral gene's chance of going extinct has nothing to do with its dominance\r\n==============\r\n\r\n![graph for chance to go extinct](http://i.imgur.com/jb4QN.png \"Chance to go extinct, has nothing to do with dominance.\")\r\n\r\nDominance affects trait prevalence\r\n==============\r\n![graph for recessive vs dominant gene demographics](http://i.imgur.com/Z4LM4.png \"This only refers to gene expression, not to be confused with chance of extinction.\")\r\n\r\n* D - the percentage of the gene pool with the dominant trait.\r\n* R - percentage of the recessive gene.\r\n* Dominant genes are likely to be expressed = D + D * R\r\n* Recessive genes are likely to be expressed = R²\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraitSim Explained\r\n========================\r\n\r\nPeople are illustrated as a pair of dots. One colored dot per gene. If the\r\nbrown eyed gene is present it will appear in front of the blue eyed gene.\r\n\r\nEach \"sex\" generation causes the entire population to randomly pair up and\r\nmake 2 children. The results are visible in the bar graphs at the bottom left.\r\nNote that when 2 parents mate, each gene from the parent is equally likely\r\nto be inherited.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the \"sex party\" on for enough time, most likely one of the gene types\r\nwill become extinct. The gene type with the lower current gene count is more likely to\r\ndecrease further. During a tie with 50% blue vs 50% brown genes,\r\nthere are likely to be 25% with blue eyes and 75% with brown eyes.\r\n\r\nNote that [eye color](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color) isn't really determined by one or two\r\ngenes.\r\n\r\nStatistics\r\n===============\r\nExpected extinction statistics for extinction in TraitSim (100 people always have 2 kids with equal initial gene counts):\r\n\r\n* average generations: 525\r\n* stddev: 372 \r\n* median: 410\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimated and drawn with the [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org) framework.\r\n\r\n[Live demo][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: http://yuvalg.com/traitsim/","tagline":"Recessive and dominant gene profileration simulation","note":"Don't delete this file!
